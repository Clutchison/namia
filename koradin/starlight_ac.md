### Areas

#### Foyer
As you step in from the plaza outside, you see that you are standing in some kind of foyer. There are some doors to the left and right of you that seem to circumnavigate the structure. Directly in front of you is a desk made of some kind of dark wood. Behind it is an elven woman, younger, in some muted gray robes.

The elf, wearing spectacles and a bit of a resting bitch face, looks up from her work.

#### Royal

As you pass from the foyer, your eyes are immediately drawn upwards to the valted contours of the enormous, glass-like dome that is The Royal. Although I say glass, you realize now that the dome actually is more of a one way mirror. Whereas outside you could see some light escaping from the structure, you now see that from the interior, the ceiling is reflecting light back in. Speaking of the light, suspended in the air are a myriad of massive blazing coldlight stones, you guess each one is likely somewhere around 10 feet by five feet in dimension. They float through the open air above and cast their white blue light down upon the sprawling landscape beneath

Beneath this spectacle, the plantlife of the Royal thrives. The flora here has an uncanney valley feeling to it, it is familiar yet alien. Trunks of trees twist in strange unnatural shapes. The undergrowth is filled with various vines, flowers, and fungus. On many of the plants you see various fruits, growing in strange shapes. In your view, you see many workers inspecting and picking the fruits, placing them into baskets and carrying them off.

You take all this in in relative silence. Other than the hum of some nearby insects and some mumbing from a nearby student inspecting one of the trees and taking some notes, there is not much sound here.
