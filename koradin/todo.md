        The interior of the building is dimly lit. A few coldlight lanterns give off some small light. The room you stand in is nearly barren. To your right is a singular, uncomfortable looking bench.  To your left is a single, solitary plant, with large purple fronds giving a small splash of color to the room. Directly in front of you is a locked door, and next to it, a barred window. On the other side is a balding male, scribbling away at something at his desk. He pays you no attention as you enter.

    The interior of the building greet you with a subtle gloom. Faint illumination ebbs from two coldlight lanterns. The room itself is starkly minimalist, no more than a box really.

    To your right, an austere, uncomfortable looking bench rests against the wall.

    On your left is a singular plant, with robust, purple fronds doing its best to add some livelihood to the room.

    Directly ahead is a locked door. Beside it is a barred window.

    Behind it sits a man of indeterminate years, diligently scribbling away at his desk. His hair has long since vacated his scalp. As you enter, he pays you no mind.

    The gates to the Starlight Academy are open and are allowing citizens and warforged to come and go, most carrying satchels or bundles of papers. Ahead is a vast courtyard. At the center is a metallic fountain. It depicts a kneeling Warforged, its hands outstretched as it accepts a flame (represented by a twinking coldlight torch) from a robed figure. Surrounding the courtyard are three domed structures.
