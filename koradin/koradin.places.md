# Character Stories

## Rennyn

Ruvaen has gotten himself involved in the Grimblade Syndicate. He went to the
street fights in the Heap and was DQ'd for using magic.

- ### Grimblade Fights

The grimblades are setting up fighting rings in order to farm talent for the
pit fights in Blackport, known as the Shadowground.

Can bet with Blood or Gold. Gold is set by insight check on skill.

If Rennyn wins, she recieves 100g and an amber token with a comet on one side
and a dagger on the other. She is instructed that Ruvaen has a debt to pay,
but she can come watch him fight if she wants in Blackport in three week's time.

## Clasp

Clasp has an opportunity to speak with the Dragons of Kor. They like his idea, but are worried about mass distribution.
For one, it would require transporting the goods from TL through either the stormlands or the Curtain, the former
being dangerous and the latter expensive.

An alternate presents itself (somehow) in the form of a flower deep the the swamps to the South.
Said to have powers of growth, it might be the catalyst necessary to mass produce the slime while
saving his home from gentrification and industry.

### The Dragon's Lair

Towering above the other buildings in the Goldstone district is the Dragon's Lair,
a massive building of obsidian and gold.  Inside, a receptionist greets the party.
The dragons are quite busy, but have an opening tomorrow a 11.

The audience chamber might be one of the most elegant spaces the party has ever
set foot. Massive obsidian columns rise to meet the vaulted ceiling, and all
along the ground, black stone is inlaid with gold in intricate, swirrling patterns.
To the left, a waterfall flows gently over and into a glass pool. To the
right are many doors, many of which continue to open and close as servants and staff
hurry about their day.  In the center is a circular cut out, two steps leading
down to where a guest might address their host. And directly in front of you,
three massive high-backed chairs that would put many a throne to shame.
Behind them are three massive banners, one of Green, one of Red, and one of Black.
And, sitting in these would be thrones, are the Dragons of Koradin. On the
left sits a human woman, exceptionally tall and slender. She is wearing an
emerald dress that sparkles in the coldlight that suffuses the room. She wears
a welcoming smile, but her eyes are locked and attentive. In the center sits
a warforged of medium build. He is wearing a vest of deep red, and is twirling
a quill in his hand absentmindedly. His metal body has been polished to a near-mirror shine,
and on his wrists are multiple pieces of jewelry, all gold and gems. Finally on the
right sits a large male Tabaxi, bearing a tortoise shell coat and wearing a
black tailored suit. He has a lion's mane that has been well groomed, and
his right hand is resting on the handle of a cane,
made of some dark, lacquered wood. He, too, watches you with a fixed stare,
but he wears no smile to ease the tension.

- They will be interested in the slime, but they will ask some hard questions.
- How much money will Clasp need to get started?
- When can he start mass production?

If he cannot answer these questions, they want nothing to do with him.

## Vehna / Damon

Vehna will be tempted by the dagger once during her travels, as it is somewhat removed from her
direct contact.

The Gotharim expert will give them information on the dagger and Damon's condition, namely:

- Damon's soul has been fractured, and the pieces are being used by Gotha (name?).
    As it stands, Damon cannot possibly win the fight, and one side or another will eventually consume him.
- The Anan Cracta holds one of the Gotha currently residing inside Damon. It might be possible to use the
dagger to extract the Gotha from Damon, but the other Gotha is uknown.

## Rhys

There is a massive temple district in Koradin. A small temple worships the Sun and Stars, but most temples
worship Gods from the time before. One unmarked building houses a shrine to the Mother.
