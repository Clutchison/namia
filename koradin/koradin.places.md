# Character Stories

## Rennyn

Ruvaen has gotten himself involved in the Grimblade Syndicate. He went to the
street fights in the Heap and was DQ'd for using magic.

- ### Grimblade Fights

The grimblades are setting up fighting rings in order to farm talent for the
pit fights in Blackport, known as the Shadowground.

Can bet with Blood or Gold. Gold is set by insight check on skill.

If Rennyn wins, she recieves 100g and an amber token with a comet on one side
and a dagger on the other. She is instructed that Ruvaen has a debt to pay,
but she can come watch him fight if she wants in Blackport in three week's time.

## Clasp

Clasp has an opportunity to speak with the Dragons of Kor. They like his idea, but are worried about mass distribution.
For one, it would require transporting the goods from TL through either the stormlands or the Curtain, the former
being dangerous and the latter expensive.

An alternate presents itself (somehow) in the form of a flower deep the the swamps to the South.
Said to have powers of growth, it might be the catalyst necessary to mass produce the slime while
saving his home from gentrification and industry.

### The Dragon's Lair

Towering above the other buildings in the Goldstone district is the Dragon's Lair,
a massive building of obsidian and gold.  Inside, a receptionist greets the party.
The dragons are quite busy, but have an opening tomorrow a 11.

The grandeur of the audience chamber is unlike anything you have experienced before.Colossal obsidian columns stretch upward, their ominous presence serving as support to a vaulted ceiling that has been painted black. Underfoot, the floor is a complex pattern of black and gold, ornate swirls winding through jet-black stone.
To your left, a waterfall cascades into a pool. The soothing murmur of the waterfall takes a slight edge off of any tension that you may be feeling. On the opposite side, a flurry of activity marks the presence of many doors. Uniformed staff hurry in and out, none of them making eye contact as they hurry about their work.
In the heart of the room is a hollowed-out circle, reachable by descending a pair of welcoming steps. Itâ€™s a stage designed to showcase the ambitions of guests who dare to present their cases before the mighty hosts. And beyond, set against the backdrop of three massive chairs that would give the grandest thrones a run for their money, are the legendary Dragons of Koradin.
on the wall behind these would-be thrones are majestic banners - left to right, emerald green, fiery red, and deep black. These banners ripple slightly in the controlled air. Seated beneath them are the Dragons.
On the left, an exceptionally tall human woman commands attention. Her slenderness is a striking contrast to the solid structure of her surroundings. Draped in an emerald dress that shimmers, as though animated by the ethereal cold light permeating the room, she exudes an inviting warmth. Her smile may be welcoming, but it is her focused, discerning eyes that hold a mesmeric pull, promising a careful scrutiny of every proposition.
In the central chair is a medium-built warforged. His deep red vest is a sharp contrast against his polished metal body, every move reflecting light that dances across the structure of the room. He twirls a quill in his hand, his seeming absentmindedness feels awkwardly out of place. His wrists bear an array of golden jewelry, studded with gems.
To the right, a sturdy male Tabaxi, adorned with a tortoise-shell coat. He is sporting a finely-tailored black suit that accentuates his large, imposing form. Across his neck is a massive well groomed lion's mane. Unlike his two compatriots, his face lacks any readable emotion. Instead he watches you approach with an unflinching gaze. His right hand rests lightly on a cane made of a dark, lacquered wood. His unwavering stare could chill the warmest hearts, adding a touch of palpable tension to the room's charged atmosphere.

- They will be interested in the slime, but they will ask some hard questions.
- How much money will Clasp need to get started?
- When can he start mass production?

If he cannot answer these questions, they want nothing to do with him.

## Vehna / Damon

Vehna will be tempted by the dagger once during her travels, as it is somewhat removed from her
direct contact.

The Gotharim expert will give them information on the dagger and Damon's condition, namely:

- Damon's soul has been fractured, and the pieces are being used by Gotha (name?).
    As it stands, Damon cannot possibly win the fight, and one side or another will eventually consume him.
- The Anan Cracta holds one of the Gotha currently residing inside Damon. It might be possible to use the
dagger to extract the Gotha from Damon, but the other Gotha is uknown.

## Rhys

There is a massive temple district in Koradin. A small temple worships the Sun and Stars, but most temples
worship Gods from the time before. One unmarked building houses a shrine to the Mother.
