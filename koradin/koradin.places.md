# Character Stories

## Rennyn

Ruvaen has gotten himself involved in the Grimblade Syndicate

## Clasp

Clasp has an opportunity to speak with the Dragons of Kor. They like his idea, but are worried about mass distribution.
For one, it would require transporting the goods from TL through either the stormlands or the Curtain, the former
being dangerous and the latter expensive.

An alternate presents itself (somehow) in the form of a flower deep the the swamps to the South.
Said to have powers of growth, it might be the catalyst necessary to mass produce the slime while
saving his home from gentrification and industry.

## Vehna / Damon

Vehna will be tempted by the dagger once during her travels, as it is somewhat removed from her
direct contact.

The Gotharim expert will give them information on the dagger and Damon's condition, namely:

- Damon's soul has been fractured, and the pieces are being used by Gotha (name?).
    As it stands, Damon cannot possibly win the fight, and one side or another will eventually consume him.
- The Anan Cracta holds one of the Gotha currently residing inside Damon. It might be possible to use the
dagger to extract the Gotha from Damon, but the other Gotha is uknown.

## Rhys

There is a massive temple district in Koradin. A small temple worships the Sun and Stars, but most temples
worship Gods from the time before. One unmarked building houses a shrine to the Mother.
