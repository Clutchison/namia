## Damon

### Current Situation

- Damon currently lives in the town of Mjor nestled in the mountains of Eo. He has proven himself to
  the Frost Elves that reside there, and although he might still get some jokes about his soft hands,
  he has made many friends in his last few years.

  One of which is an elderly Kanjorian who goes by the name of Amarach. Each week, they meet up at
  the local tavern and play Rin, a chesslike game where each piece moves differently depending on
  the color of the square they occupy.

  Damon has never one a game, but has made a bet with Amarach that if he ever wins, he'll tell him
  what his tattoo means. Amarach converses about the increase in demon attacks from the well, and
  mentions his worry that we're burning through too much silver.

  J walks into the tavern and catches Damon's eye. J winks then points out a winning move to Damon.

  Amarach sighs and says he'll make good on his promise, then excuses himself for a moment.

  (Expecting Damon to come up to J in the meantime)

  J recognizes Damon as a sky elf, then asks some questions about his life. After getting to know him
  a bit, J leans in and asks if Damon might be interested in making some coin and possibly helping
  out an individual whose freedom is in jeapardy.

  J tells him he has some other business, but to meet him in the town of Whiteglow in a month.

  Amarach comes back and sits down with a pint of alcohol for both of them. He has inscribed a few
  more lines into his tattoo, and small lines of blood carve paths down his arm.

  "For the longest time, I feared that my word was _death_, and so, as I neared the final discovery,
  I fled to this remote corner of the world. And now, after all this time, did I...

  Sound fades as Damon is drawn into the swirling lines. CHA Save DC 15 to discover the name of
  Freedom.
