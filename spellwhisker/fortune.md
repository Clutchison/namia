# The Fortune Teller

## TODOs

- Seer's Guild: Lithoseer

## Brainstorm

Alistar is before anything else, a professional. He has a tight haircut,
he speaks clearly and confidently. His words have the feeling that he
has said them many times before this, and that they encompass all of the typical
questions one might have.

Alistar is a lithoseer. He has a license that is signed by the Council of Precognition
to prophesy.

## Prophecy Problem

Prophecies are actually looking into the past at all of the timelines that have been rewound
due to the Everstorm. Because of this:

- Prior to the end of the war, fortene telling was looked down on as psuedomagic
- FTs cannot see the future, but rather an abstract "average" of the previous timelines
- FTs cannot see past the resetting of the Everstorm

## The Man

TODO: Describe in order: Height, clothing, mannerisms, facial features, scar

- Alistar Veridian stands at a respectable height of perhaps 5'10". His face is angular,
with a strong jawline. He has fair skin and is sporting a five oclock shadow. His eyes have a
piercing quality to them, and there is a strong feeling that he is seeing right throough you.
As he continues to pack up his shop, you notice that his movements are slow, deliberate,
yet lacking any wasted motion. One feature that does stand out is a scar that runs from the middle
of his right cheek down to his upper lip. There is a large amount of scar tissue surrounding the
old wound that causes his lip to contort in unique ways as he speaks, although it doesn't appear
to have any impact on his ability to properly pronounce words.

## The Speech

Welcome, I am Alistar Veridian, accredited lithomancer by the Council of Precognition.
As per our arrangement, I will be using my talents to peer into your potential future and
grant you a prophecy. It is important that I inform you that whatever outcome I see,
it is merely a convergent abstraction of possible events. In other words, it is a vague
amalgamation of the most likely outcomes. Nothing is guaranteed, and by hearing your prophecy,
you have already chosen a different path than the one I have seen.

In regards to the obscurity of the prophecy, that is out of my control. I am here to read your path
and recite the prophecy I see. Any interpretation is left to you. If you are unhappy with your future,
please do not take your anger out on myself. Instead, perhaps put that energy into steering your life
in a preferred direction.

Are we ready to begin?

## Abyssalite

A mixture of abyssalite and charcoal is applied to various parts of the body. Those trained in magic will notice that many of the locations
line up with where their spell slots reside.
