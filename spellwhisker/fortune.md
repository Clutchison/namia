# The Fortune Teller

## TODOs

- Seer's Guild
- Korian Leader title and name
- Korian council that has approved Seer's license
- Everstorm reset date

## Brainstorm

The FT is before anything else, a professional. He has a tight haircut,
he speaks clearly and confidently. His words have the feeling that he
has said them many times before this, and that they encompass all of the typical
questions one might have.

FT is a member of a guild of Seers. He has a license and has approval from the Korian leader
to prophesy.

## Prophecy Problem

Prophecies are actually looking into the past at all of the timelines that have been rewound
due to the Everstorm. Because of this:

- Prior to the end of the war, fortune telling was looked down on as psuedomagic
- FTs cannot see the future, but rather an abstract "average" of the previous timelines
- FTs cannot see past the resetting of the Everstorm

## The Man

TODO: Describe in order: Height, clothing, mannerisms, facial features, scar

- Alistar Veridian stands at a respectable height of perhaps 5'10". His face is oval,
with a strong, chiseled jawline that has a sense of regality to him. He has fair skin,
though is sporting a five oclock shadow. His eyes, while lacking any malice, have a
piercing quality to them. As he continues to pack up his shop, you notice that his
movements are slow, deliberate, yet lacking any wasted motion. One feature that does
stand out is a scar that runs from the middle of his right cheek down to his upper lip.
There is a large amount of scar tissue surrounding the old wound that causes his lip to contort
in unique ways as he speaks, although it doesn't appear to have any impact on his ability
to properly pronounce words.
