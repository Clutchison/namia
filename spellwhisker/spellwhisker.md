# Spellwhisker

Cresting a hill, you see sprawled out in a valley below you, a decently sized town.
Electric/torch lights illuminate the night. To the left of a town is what appears
to be a stone quarry, and up on a hill in the distance lies a solitary tower.

# The Cult of the Motherless

The temple to the Gray Smith has been burned to the ground. Inside, a ritual
seems to have taken place, and a demon well has been opened. The cult of
the motherless is responsible. Thankfully, the cultists have already been
dispatched by Thalendrius. They can be found in a burning pile outside of town.

- Reside to the South at Galar's Rest.
    (Age of Stars ruins that was used as refuge during Age of Dark. Now a swamp.)
- They once worshipped the God of Death known as the Mother.
- While originally not a threat, they have recently become hostile and have
been wantonly murdering and desecrating holy sites.

- Additionally, it appears that they have learned how to create Demon Wells.
