# Damon's Demons

- Choice: Let GD assist 
- Challenge: CHA Save against BD

The crowd surrges into the caves. Damon stays behind and waits at the entrance. As he sits down to 
contemplate his next move, he here's a voice.

"Y ov Mornesari, my friend."

Another Damon sits, cross-legged and back straight. He seems older. Crows feet are at the corner
of his eyes and is clean shaven. He isn't wearing what you're wearing, instead some relaxed silken 
shirt and stretchy pants. His face is calm, and his voice carries a comforting, almost condescending tone.

```note
  GD wants what is best for everyone. He is willing to play it slow and think strategically.
  He will not force himself on ND unless absolutely necessary.
```

After some conversation:

"Listen, I need you. I can't be divided like this, not while he's in here. If you let me in control,
we can beat him."

Damon realizes he has been hearing the sound of metal on wood. He turns to see yet another
Damon, leaning against the cave wall. In his hands are a whittling knife and a stick, which is 
in the process of being shaved down to a point.

Unlike the last, this new Damon looks exactly like you. Same clothes, same stubble. But then he looks
up from his work and meets your gaze, and in those eyes you see murder.

"Were I in my right mind, I would have never let that kind of power out of my sight. I have no
idea what I've been doing all these years, but I think it's time I came to my senses."

The light in the room begins to recede.

"I know you think you're in charge here, but let me make one thing clear. I'm not the devil on
your shoulder. You're the devil on mine."

# The Morning After

- The party awakes in the crypt, except for Farah, who continues to dream. She cannot be woken, 
and tosses and turns as if in a nightmare.

## Tristan

- Wisdom check to determine Farah is at the GY.
- Survival check to get to the cemetery.
- If made it to the cemetery, Athletics to get door open
- Else another Survival to find shelter.
