# Damon's Demons

- Choice: Let GD assist
- Challenge: CHA Save against BD

The crowd surges into the caves. Damon stays behind and waits at the entrance.
As he sits down to contemplate his next move, he here's a voice.
```
    "Y ov Mornesari, my friend."

    Another Damon sits, cross-legged and back straight. He seems older. He glows with a faint white aura.
    He isn't wearing what you're wearing, instead some relaxed silken shirt and stretchy pants.
    His face is calm, and his voice carries a comforting, almost condescending tone.

    I once was something else, but now I am Damon. I grew up with wealth and priveledge that
    I did not appreciate. I have been running for such a long time. But now I see who I really
    am.
```

GD wants what is best for everyone. He is willing to play it slow and think strategically.
He will not force himself on ND unless absolutely necessary.

After some conversation:
```
    "Listen, I need you. I can't be divided like this, not while he's in here. If you cede control,
    we can beat him."

    You realize that, how long has it been there?, there has been
    the scrabe of metal on wood. You turn, slowly looking over your shoulder.
    Leaning against the cave wall is yet another Damon. In his hands are your carving knife
    and a slender piece of wood. He is in the process of whittling the stick into
    a sharp point. Each pass of the knife is slow, but forceful.

    Unlike the Damon behind you, this new Damon looks _exactly_ like you. Same clothes,
    same stubble. But then he looks up from the work in his hands, and in those eyes,
    you see murder.

    "I refuse to converse with the illusory voices of my mind."

    "Were I in a proper state, I would have never let that kind of power out of my sight. I have no
    idea what I've been doing all these years, but I think it's time I came to my senses."
```

The light in the room begins to recede.
```
    "I know you think you're in charge here, but let me make one thing clear.
    I'm not the devil on your shoulder. You're the devil on mine."

    Damon's guitar begins to strum on its own in a haunting, discordant melody.

    A means to an end.
    gæθɑnɑn ækɑlɑkɐx.
    The chase now begins.
```

Damon drops to his knees, clutching at his left arm. Every cut burns as if hot
oil had been poured into the open wound. You struggle to keep your wits. As your mind
races, you sense, as if always out of the corner of your eye, the other alien presence.
You feel it reach out, offering to take over and fight for you.
What are you thinking in this moment, and what do you do?

# The Morning After

```
    Vehna, you flee from the nightmare that was not your own. You run through the city streets, some northern mountain town.
    You turn a corner and suddenly hear a voice. "Do not run, child of the wind, for this is not your nightmare."
    The voice came from somewhere up above you. You look up, and see. A city. Your city. Floating upside down, the sands
    stretching out in all directions. You feel your feet lift up, and suddenly you're falling up,
    into the sky that is the ground, towards the golden towers of Kof Monabaiza. The wind begins to rush around you.
    In your ears, through the gale you hear a cacophony of voices, ghosts from another nightmare.

    "The Shah! The Shah is dead!"

    “All those with the blood of the Djinn could be targets.”

    "Sieze the Sharifah!"

    “The name's Tayan. They’re gonna be here soon. Let’s go!”

    "The Shah! Oh God's, the Shah!"

    Then, through the voices and the gale cuts the first voice. It is deep,
    ancient, and leaves you feeling like a leaf blown through a storm.

    "The Dark comes, as it always does. This world has shied away from it's
    sins for too long, and now the balance cannot be maintained. Another king
    waits for your blade, and this time you must not fail."

    Directly above (or below) is the palace, and from it's doors pours an inky
    black substance. It runs like a river and spreads through the city streets,
    leaving behind an intricate design that only one in your vantage point could
    appreciate. The Sun to your left darkens, and you realize you're speeding up.
    The palace rapidly approaches.

    The voice again in your ears, but this time you notice something else. There is a weariness,
    an edge of raggedness. And beneath that, is it desperation? Or madness?

    "Darkness comes for us all, and the balance cannot be kept. I have been with it for so long.
    So very long.........."

    The palace is racing towards you. You brace for impact as the now obsidian structure screams towards you.
    Your heart races and your stomach turns, And at the the moment of impact, you wake up.
```

- The party awakes in the crypt, except for Farah, who continues to dream.
  She cannot be woken, and tosses and turns as if in a nightmare.

## Tristan

Tristan went looking for Farah. Depending on these rolls, his fate is determined.

- Wisdom check to determine Farah is at the GY.
- Survival check to get to the cemetery.
- If made it to the cemetery, Athletics to get door open
- Else another Survival to find shelter.

## The Stormwardens

Damon has been taken to the center of town by the Stormwardens.

```
    There is a congregation around the wardstone. You see two individuals, both in road-travelled
    royal, blue cloaks. The smaller of the two is a man, perhaps 5'7, stubble on his face and
    a mop of black curly hair, speaks to the crowd with a calming voice.

    Behind him, a massive warforged, more than six feet tall, is running his hands
    along the once molten, now cooled silver. As his hand passes over the metal, the
    excess metal drippings evaporate, and all that is left is a smooth, almost imperceptable
    seem.

    At their feet, lies Damon. He appears to be unconconcious, and his hands and feet are tied.

    Both individuals are armed, the smaller with a longsword at his hip and the larger with a greatsword
    strapped to his back. Both seem of similar design, with well made handles that have
    intricate, swirling patterns that run along their hilts.

    Painkeepers - Storm name for Somberchildren

    "I know that you have been afraid. Only the insane would look into the heart of
    the storm and not feel fear. But it is only through that pain that the storm offers
    that we can find the clarity to calm the gale within our own hearts."

    "Ah, and do we have here our would be wardsmiths?"
```

The SWs only want Damon to answer for his crimes if they believe that he genuinely
wanted to hurt Farah. If they discover that the party has Farah, they will take
her forcefully if necessary.

### Pitch

Handout

- To sign up, you must make an initial fee of 300 gold.
- After that, a monthly fee of at least 200 gold is due every two weeks.
- Every week, a random assortment of five magical items will be available for
    purchase. The maximum value of an available item is five times the fee.
- If you find other new merchants to work below you, they will increase the potential
    item value, with each merchant beneath you increasing the maximum possible value
    of an item by an amount equal to your fee. As an example, with no merchants beneath you,
    the maximum value of an item is five times your fee. If you had two merchants below you,
    it would be seven times your fee.
- You may purchase these items for 90 percent of their value. If they are not
    returned to the bag after ten minutes, you will be excused from service.
- You may reroll your items once a day by paying half of your fee again.
- You may increase your fee at any time, but you may never reduce your fee once
    it has been increased. Increasing your fee by one and a half times will also
    count as a reroll.
- If you do not pay your fee by the end of the fourteenth day, you will be excused from service.
- If excused from service, members of M5 will appear and sieze all goods that belong to
    Melvin. In addition, other goods may be siezed to recuperate lost fees, deemed appropriate
    by the repossesors at the time.
- M5 is not liable for any harm that comes to those who refuse to pay their fees.
