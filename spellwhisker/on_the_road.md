# Damon's Demons

- Choice: Let GD assist
- Challenge: CHA Save against BD

The crowd surges into the caves. Damon stays behind and waits at the entrance.
As he sits down to contemplate his next move, he here's a voice.
```
    "Y ov Mornesari, my friend."

    Another Damon sits, cross-legged and back straight. He seems older. Crows feet are at the corner
    of his eyes and is clean shaven. He isn't wearing what you're wearing, instead some relaxed silken
    shirt and stretchy pants. His face is calm, and his voice carries a comforting, almost condescending tone.
```

GD wants what is best for everyone. He is willing to play it slow and think strategically.
He will not force himself on ND unless absolutely necessary.

After some conversation:
```
    "Listen, I need you. I can't be divided like this, not while he's in here. If you let me in control,
    we can beat him."

    You realize that, for some amount of time you're not sure, there has been
    the scrabe of metal on wood. You turn, slowly looking over your shoulder.
    Leaning against the cave wall is yet another Damon. In his hands are a knife
    and a slender piece of wood. He is in the process of whittling the stick into
    a sharp point. Each pass of the knife is slow, but forceful.

    Unlike the Damon behind you, this new Damon looks _exactly_ like you. Same clothes,
    same stubble. But then he looks up from the work in his hands, and in those eyes,
    you see murder.

    "Were I in my right mind, I would have never let that kind of power out of my sight. I have no
    idea what I've been doing all these years, but I think it's time I came to my senses."
```

The light in the room begins to recede.
```
    "I know you think you're in charge here, but let me make one thing clear.
    I'm not the devil on your shoulder. You're the devil on mine."
```

# The Morning After

- The party awakes in the crypt, except for Farah, who continues to dream.
  She cannot be woken, and tosses and turns as if in a nightmare.

## Tristan

- Wisdom check to determine Farah is at the GY.
- Survival check to get to the cemetery.
- If made it to the cemetery, Athletics to get door open
- Else another Survival to find shelter.
