# The Calm

## In the Shack

    Ask for Con Saves from Da'Mon / Vehna DC 12

### Arun

Arun is contemplative. If asked, he will say that he wants to be like Da'Mon,
sure of his way and knowing of his tenet.
More than anything, he was happy that he helped Vehna escape. He felt purpose then. Arun believes he found his tenet, but will not speak any further on it. ### The Dream
Rhys appears in an empty coffee shop. The only light is a pale glow emanating from
somewhere outside. Sitting (more leaning actually) at the bar is Jay.

"Hello there, young man. It has been too long." --Coughs

Jay will be cryptic, as usual.

"The plan was to leave you all in the lurch. It was important that you thought
I had betrayed you for some nefarious purpose. But unfortunately, my partner
in research has had quite the revelation, and the ramifications are such that
this, that you, are our last shot at this." -coughing fit

What? "Putting everything right again."

"I cannot tell you everything, and I am terribly sorry that I must be cryptic.
I am assured by my colleague that were I to tell you our exact location, Miss Valdove
would be storming the castle, so to speak, in no time. Not to say we're in a castle, hehe."

"Here is what you need to know. When you wake up, you're going to find a storm far stronger
than what those so-called storm-seers predicted. And if you don't find your way through it
to the girl, we're all doomed. Now, when you find her, you have two choices. You can try and
talk to her, get her to come with you and learn about who she is, and what she has done.
Or, you can put a stop to all of this right now, and take that shard of the old world and
put her out of her misery.

The choice is yours, but just so you know, there are many that would say she deserved far worse
for what she's done."
