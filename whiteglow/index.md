# Welcome to Whiteglow

Clasp. A storm on the horizon. Mist covers the ground and swirls around your ankles. The chill in the air, unusual for this time of year but typical for an approaching Roller. Checking your rainmap, Clasp, you see you made the promised date, and with two days before.

- Used to introduce themes of the world:
 - Stuck in cycle
 - Seemingly at peace, but unease and rot beneath the surface
 - Lots of old pain here.

  - Arun and the rest of the party are here but Jay is nowhere in sight.  Arun informs the party that their first task was to recover an amulet from a long dead wizard's laboratory nearby. A group known as the Grimblade Syndicate have recently discovered the location as well, and Arun is concerned that they are on their trail.
  - Arun tells the party that, among other things, the storms have been getting worse as of late. Something is wrong with the world. And this amulet might help Jay discover what is the reason for the storms.
  - Farah, the daughter of the innkeeper, has been feeling strange lately. An Arcstorm is on the horizon, and the inn is packed with travelers intent on waiting out the storm. Right as the rain begins, Farah vanishes.
  - A man named Cerrick with a Comet tattoo has been inhabiting a shack on the outskirts of town. Known as quite the card shark, he has been teaching Farah how to play poker. As Farah vanishes, so does Cerrick.

## Knowledge of Arctorms

- The Everstorm, a magical torrent that has persisted since the end of the Twilight War.
- Sends out so-called arcstorms at periodic intervals that ravage the countryside, having strange, often deadly, effects on the landscape.
- Broken into categories:
  - "Roller:" Categorized by a preceding mist, followed by a slow buildup of heavy rain.
  - "Thunderer" Rather than mist, intense thunder heralds the storm. No rain typically falls, but there is a high concentration of lightning, and any magic tends to act erratically.
  - "Flasher": Considered the most deadly due to it's unpredictability and speed. Characterized by a smell of sulfur in the air.

## Waystones

- Living proof of the Twilight Treaty. Magical, white monoliths that seem to ward off the majority of the effects of the arcstorms.
- Order of the Silent Way maintains them. While technically unaligned to either empire, it is well known that the Order will bring so-called somberchildren to Drakkur's capitol.
- Whiteglow's waystone is in a state of disrepair, and there are grumblings among the inn's citizens about the delay in the Order's repairs, despite the heavy payment they have received.

## Folk in the Inn - Healing Light Inn

- Inkeep: Tristan. Father of Farah
- Galathil: Ancient Wood Elf. Is telling stories from his youth to a group of some adults and mostly children. Sitting near the hearth.
- Cerrick, another drunken citizen (Micah) are sitting at a table playing poker.
- Farah: Running around pouring drinks. 
- Various groups of travelers take up tables to themselves. One group appears to be eyeing the party, but is actually eyeing Cerrick.

## High Mage Dravenath's Lair

- Somewhere in the foothills near Whiteglow.
- Hills of Dravenath, Calling Hills
- Entrance is surrounded by Frostflower, which only blooms when cold. At this time of year, the only time that this will happen is before a storm.
- General destination can be found by asking around town. Folk will be unwilling to give it's location as it there are many local legends surrounding it. Myths say that the wailing of a man can be heard in the hills nearby, and folk have had strange hallucinations when in the area. Even more distressing, some folk have cited an unusual desire to seek.
- Riddle on the door: "Know me, and all doors are open to you."
- SPIDERS
