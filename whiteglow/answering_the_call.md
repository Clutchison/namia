# Answering the Call (Cerrick's and the Calling Hills)

## Cerrick's Hut

- Five members of the Grimblade Syndicate have come for Cerrick. They had been staking out his hut for a few hours before the party shows up. Upon getting him to open a door, one scout grimblade uses the opportunity to attempt to shoot Cerrick with an arrow. The door slams shut. The party turns to fight the foe they happen to be in the way of.
- Arun hides immediately.
- After the surprise round, a wave of golden light travels through the walls of the cabin and across the landscape. All members of the party (including Arun) are circled in a golden light. After any party member defeats a grimblade, the light passes inside the member and paralyzes them for a minute. Afterwards, they level up.

## Lair of Dravenath

- The party comes to a clearing of Frostflowers. The field of flowers is about 80ft by 50 ft. with a small empty patch in the center, about 35ft by 20ft.
- Nearby, a hole in the nearby ground leads to an underground cave. 
- The cave spirals down for a few feet, then levels out into a large cavern. Roots hang from the ceiling. Bones litter the ground, and some skeletons actually seem to be held aloft by roots.
- SPIDER ATTACK
- The party discovers an open door with a riddle written in ancient elven.
 _You can see me in water, but I am never wet. What am I?_
- The space appears picked clean. In one room, there appears to be a large altar. The doors to this chamber have been blown off, and there are cracks in the wall. On the ground is an empty deck of cards.
- Hidden door in wall of dining room. In order to open it, a drop of royal blood must be placed in the globlet affixed to the nearby table.
- Inscribed in the goblet in ancient elven:
  _Drink of the strong10?chosen15?noble20 and sieze the future._
- Inside the hidden bedchambers are a few items:
- Coins containing 1100 gold and 65 silver.
- Broken mirror, pendant containing incredibly faded portrait of a young woman.
- Amulet of
