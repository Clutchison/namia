## Table Expectations

### General Expectations
- Not my story, not your story, our story

### RP Guidelines
- Tone will range from silly to dramatic, but please try to lean in to the tone in the moment.
- Improv rules apply: 
 - Lift others up when possible
 - Character conflict is fine, but there is an assumption that you are all willing to adventure together.
- Boundaries
 - TODO

 - Details / Announcements




### Player Expectations
- There's 8 of you. Know your character.
- Dice Rolling. Any kind. Please don't cheat.

### DM Expectations
- If you aren't having fun, tell me and we'll make it happen.
- I am the moderator. I am not afraid to talk to someone if they need it.
- I will do my best to let you know in advance if the session will be cancelled/moved. 

### Takebacks, Mistakes and PC Death
- Takebacks will be limited, and that's ok.
 - Will likely only occur when player knowledge, not PC knowledge was incorrect or when I forgot something critical to the situation.
- Deaths might happen, and that's ok.
- I will not kill your character unfairly.

### Campaign Framework

- Difficulty will ramp.
- There is a main story with good, bad and gray actors that will take actions whether or not the players intervene or care.
- The early levels will be mostly filled with PC quests.
- There are multiple agents acting that have their own motivations.
- If you want to bake, open a fucking bakery.
- Do not rely on old player knowledge about monster stats.

### House Rules

- Always round up.
- Identify works differently depending on level
  - 1-2: Magical? Stat boost? Rarity?
  - 3-4: Additional Properties? Glimpse into past ownership. Nonlethal curses.
  - 5+: Name, full past history, Lethal curses.
- Detect magic works differently.
 - Does not tell you the school of magic. Instead specifies divine, arcane, or natural only.
 - Successful arcana check can then determine school / intent.
- No flanking
- Inspiration is now combat-specific. Any inspiration left at end of combat is lost.
 - On a PC crit, every other PC that witnesses the event rolls a d20. On an 11-20, they receive inspiration.
 - On a PC fail, every other PC that witness the event rolls a d20. On a 1-10, they lose inspiration if they have it.
 - On a PC KO, every PC that witnesses rolls a d20. On a 1-15, they lose inspiration if they have it. 
 - On a PC death, every PC that witnesses rolls a d20. On a 1-19, they lose inspiration. On a 20, they gain it.
 - Take a potion as a bonus
 - Crit? Max damage + reroll
 - Double 20 / Double 1 stuff
