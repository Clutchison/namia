## Damon's experience

As Damon enters his room, he is shoved up against the wall. Evil Damon confronts him about wasting more of their time.
He complains about how there is so much knowledge here and so much power, and he isn't doing anything to take advantage of it.
If he doesn't start getting his shit together, he won't be in charge anymore.

#### Books
- A meta-analysis on the Everstorm and it's impacts on the economy
    - Describes mostly boring socioeconomic impacts of the everstorm.
- Divination for Dullards
    - Apologetic for Divination
    - With the exception of lithomancy, there has never been any proof that any prophecy since the Age of Stars has been anything more than a lucky guess.
- Not a hoax: Proof of the depth and voracity of Lithoseer prophecies
    - Detailed description of lithomancy and how it's use of abyssalite might allow it to actually see into the future.
    - Describes the birth of this new practice within the last 80 years.
    - DC 12 Investigation: There is a footnote about how no prophecy has seen past the year of 1257 PD.
- Abyssalite and it's unique properties
    - Goes into detail about how abyssalite seems to exist partially outside of time.
    - Working with the material is very dangerous, as it can cause your mind to fracture. Many who work with the material use a mindflasher in order to preserve their sanity.
- Strength of Soul - Remembering one's past lives
    - Seems to be written by a shunned scholar of some kind, as there are multiple defensive statements interspersed with the claims of the book.
    - The author goes on to talk about how the greatest legends of the past were likely only so because they were able to maintain their identity and strength between lives.
    - DC 12 Inv: The author makes a distinction between remembering past lives and what he calls "Rapid onset short-term insight," which is a phenomenon where an individual will suddenly have precise knowledge of the details of an event moments before it happens. Notes that the rates of this phenomenon has been increasing in recent years, but muses whether that is simply due to more interest by scholars.
- Immune to the Glass Sickness. The curious case of Kof Monabaiza
    - Describes how the citizens of Kof Monabaiza, despite being a mix of various races and cultures, all seem to be immune to the disease known as The Glass Sickness.
    - No solid evidence has been found, but some theories include higher quality food and water and the general xenophobia shown to those who make the desert proper their home.
    - Some more radical beliefs are also presented, but there is little evidence for them. Included in this list are: The city sits on a previously unknown magical leyline, the city is blessed by a god, and the city executes any who have the sickness to give the impression that it is clean.
- J's Notes
    - "These notes are obviously only for myself. Richard will handle the findings that will be passed on to my successor. Although, if I am correct, this might be the last chance we have."
    - The candidates seem likely to fail if they end up with the Anan Cracta. I am sending along a scapegoat that will hopefully take the cursed thing and rid us of at least one headache.
    - "I am confident that this group is our best chance at breaking the cycle. They are all motivated and capable, and their previous failures will guide them to ultimate success."
    - "I believe that were it not for the imminent demonic threat and the motherless fools who are hastening its approach, we would no doubt succeed. But we do not have the luxury of another shot. I am concerned that their ritual at Galar's Rest will bear fruit. If that is the case, then our candidates will have one final shot to break the cycle."
    - "I am going to Kof Monabaiza. My research partner has discovered something quite unsettling. If she is correct, then we have even less time than anticipated."
- The Crimes of the Red General
    - Opinionated and political book documenting the life of Emberstaff Irenia and her place in the Twilight War.
    - Among her other crimes, her most infamous act is the use of forgotten magic that was said to break the sanction on recursion.
    - Discusses possible damage to the barriers between planes as well as the fabric of reality itself. The author lies the blame for the birth of the Everstorm squarely at her feet.
    - Mentions that while the Mirror Project ended up failing, the valiant efforts were not forgotten, and that in the end she caused her own demise.

## Rotten

### Gotharim expert (Lysander Grimalkin)
As you step into the cramped, dimly lit apartment, a musty scent immediately assaults your senses. The air hangs heavy with the smell of old parchment and dusty tomes. The apartment is small, barely more than a single room, with a low ceiling that seems to press down upon you.

The walls are lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, their wooden frames creaking under the weight of countless volumes. The books themselves are worn, their covers faded and tattered, some even missing entirely. Titles written in archaic languages and cryptic symbols adorn their spines, hinting at the knowledge they contain.

A rickety wooden desk takes center stage in the room, cluttered with stacks of loose papers and parchments filled with hastily scribbled notes and diagrams. The desk is strewn with quills, ink bottles, and half-empty cups of some kind of cold liquid, evidence of countless sleepless nights. There is an hourglass on the table made of a light wood. The surface is marred by ink stains and burn marks.

A single threadbare armchair rests by a small, cracked window, its once vibrant color faded to a somber gray. The cushions have lost their plushness, sagging under the weight of years. Next to the chair is some kind of complicated coldlight machine.

At the desk is a hunched figure with a wide. He scribbles furiously as he peers back and forth from two different open texts. His hair is long, wiry and black, and it pours over his shoulders and in front of his face. He's wearing a thick, drab robe with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows.

- Damon's soul has been fractured, and the pieces are being used by Gotha.
    As it stands, Damon cannot possibly win the fight, and one side or another will eventually consume him.
- The Anan Cracta holds one of the Gotha currently residing inside Damon. It might be possible to use the dagger to extract the Gotha from Damon, but the other Gotha is uknown.
- The dagger would need to be reforged and made into an Anan Recendin. Would require silver, abyssalite, and coldstone. Gives hastily scrawled image and description.
- But entrapping the Gotha back into the Anan Recendin would require a massive amount of magic. Typically done with a circle of 10 mages that can cast magic at the highest level. Knows that the Academy has a historical text in their archives written by a mage named Octarian Lenil that might contain the specifics of the spell.

## The Heap

As your party approaches the entrance, the towering gates reveal more rust and weathering than decorative detail. Of all of the city you have seen so far, this district appears to be the oldest and least maintained. Their is some kind of metallic dust in the air that sticks to your tongue with each inhalation.

The streets of are narrow, winding paths, cobbled together with scraps and filled with potholes that have been hastily patched. Buildings lean precariously. Some are ancient, made of stone that is crumbling apart and has you concerned that they will come crashing down any minute, while others are constructed from salvaged metal and wood. The architecture is a patchwork of desperation and innovation.

The inhabitants of the district all move with a hurried step. Most are Flamekin, with rusted plates covering their bodies and hypervigilant expressions covering their faces.

The clanging of metal can be heard as Kin labor in makeshift workshops, crafting and repairing with an artisan's touch. Market stalls are filled with salvaged parts and strange gadgets.

## Rotten

As you enter the district, you discover that is aptly named. The first thing that strikes you is the damp, earthy scent that seems to permeate everything. It's a smell that clings to the back of your throat, a combination of decaying wood and stagnant water. The air is heavy with a sense of decay.

The buildings here are a far cry from the well-constructed stone and brick you have found in the city so far. Instead, the structures are fashioned from a strange porous wood, twisted and gnarled like the limbs of a suffering tree. Their timbers groan and creak as citizens come and go from their dwellings.

The inhabitants of the Rotten district move with a quiet, resigned air. Their faces are worn, and their eyes averted.
