# Defiance of Darkness

## Intro

All you have ever known, is Darkness. Your mothers and fathers, were you lucky enough to know them before they perished, told you tails of a long ago time, an age of sun and stars. But fairy 

_PCs are survivors of the age of dark. They are all level 3 and are not divine classed.
Huddled in Somberholde, they await out a demon attack, a common occurence for the time. But 
Somberholde has stood for over generations, and the PCs have faith in the Archivus Drakkenhand,
high mage and hero of the age._

_The PCs are huddled in an underground bunker as Archivus and his trained battlemages, the Dragonclaws,
fight back the hordes that are assaulting the walls of the city. However, something is wrong. There
is commotion up above. Did the demons make it through?_

_Suddenly, the trapdoor to the bunker opens up with a loud bang. Everyone huddles as two Claws 
climb down the ladder. They call out the PCs one by one by name and let them know that the only thing 
worse than demons have come for them. Angels. Ancient beings from the Reaping Wars who seek out 
seemingly random beings and execute them. Archivus has a standing order to defend anyone who has been targeted._

_The PCs are ushered out of the safehouse. They are told that they need to make it through the city to 
the Somberholde Academy, where the inner sanctum is warded against angels. The claws will guide them,
but they need to move._

_The PCs and the two Claws,  make their way out of the bunker. They are in the slums, where 
the poorest of the population are packed together in ramshackel wooden housing. The streets twist
and turn haphazardly, and filth and yesterday's rainwater mix on the streets. Lights from the torches 
reflect in the sewage and light the way. In the far distance, a powerful daylight spell marks where Archivus is battling the Angels. Sounds of thunder and brief flashes of light mark the presence of battle._

## Claws

- Renla. a rough looking woman with a missing eye. Long blonde hair that appears burned from something recent.
- Gentry. a man with a face with gentle features but an unwavering stare. 

## Encounters

Mephit attack. One mephit per person attack them.

- Two Belazu corner the group. Renla and Gentry tell the PCs to go on ahead.

- PCs enter the richer part of town. Stone buildings instead of wood, and some doors even have arcane wards inscribed on their faces. Instead of torches, arcane lanterns swing in the wind and light the way with an unwavering light.

- The PCs hear cries from help from a wealthy building. If they investigate, a Belazu is in the process of massacreing a rich family. A 14 year old girl and what appears to be her father lie dead on the ground, cut in half. A young boy stands in between the Belazu and his mother. He appears to have wet himself, and he is holding a small dagger with a wavering hand.

- They make their way through to the Academy proper. Tall buildings of stone, too high to see from the light on the ground. Behind them, Archivus' daylight vanishes.

Cobblestone becomes tiled worked stone underfoot. Ahead, finally, the Sombeholde courtyard comes into view. Small blue lights flicker and illuminate a rare sight. A garden of pale roses. Ahead, the large wooden door to the academy looms. The final stretch.  With a loud crack, a great gray being slams into the ground between the party and the door. Standing up, a being made of gray stone. Vast gray wings fold with a cracking like bone. A featureless, triagular face, with a stone halo that encircles the head at the level where its eyes would be. Long sharp appendages for hands extend, three long spindly fingers hold a scythe made of a dark metal that reflects the blue lights of the garden.

"You shall be now be taken."
"Ymg' ahor hai ah mgepmggoka"

One by one the party is slain. 

With the last member alive, the sun alights on the horizon. The angel screeches and vanishes into black mist.
