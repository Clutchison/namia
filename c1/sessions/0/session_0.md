## Table Expectations

### General Expectations
- Not my story, not your story, our story

### RP Guidelines
- Tone will range from silly to dramatic, but please try to lean in to the tone in the moment.
- Improv rules apply: 
 - Lift others up when possible
 - Character conflict is fine, but there is an assumption that you are all willing to adventure together.
- Boundaries
 - TODO

 - Details / Announcements

### Player Expectations
- Dice Rolling. Any kind. Please don't cheat.

### DM Expectations
- If you aren't having fun, tell me and we'll make it happen.
- I am the moderator. I am not afraid to talk to someone if they need it.
- I will do my best to let you know in advance if the session will be cancelled/moved. 

### Takebacks, Mistakes and PC Death
- Takebacks will be limited, and that's ok.
 - Will likely only occur when player knowledge, not PC knowledge was incorrect or when I forgot something critical to the situation.
- Deaths might happen, and that's ok.
- I will not kill your character unfairly.

### Campaign Framework

- Difficulty will ramp.
- There is a main story with good, bad and gray actors that will take actions whether or not the players intervene or care.
- There are multiple agents acting that have their own motivations.
- If you want to bake, open a fucking bakery.
- Do not rely on old player knowledge about monster stats.

### House Rules

- Always round up.

#### Inspiration

Inspiration is now combat-specific

When you roll initiative, if your number rolled (without your modifier) is less than or equal to your character level, you gain initiative.

You also gain initiative if you are the last player to act.

Initiative can be used as normal. In addition, it can be used to automatically succeed on a death save.

#### Enemy Murder Tactics

Whether or not an enemy will attempt to kill a downed player is based on it's intelligence.

- 0-8: If creature is aggressive, will always try to kill. If creature is defensive, will always back off.
- 9-14: Will only kill if feeling unthreatened. Will ignore healers until it has been made very obvious.
- 15+: Will make tactical decision including all information.

#### Differing info for detect magic based on mental stat

- Int: You know the school of magic, if there is one
- Wis: You know whether the magic is divine or arcane in nature
- Cha: You know the level of the spell
