"You're falling. The same dream again, the one from the storm. You're suspended in air, your hair whipping past your face. To your right, the Sun
hangs in the sky, an eye watching you from the distant horizon. Above and below you are two planes, a forest of pine at your feet and a desert city--your desert city--above.
You hear in your ear the same, tired, powerful voice.

"I've fought for so long... But now they are coming. You cannot run, child of the wind. There is nowhere left to run to."

The palace above once again begins to leak. Pitch black substance pours from the windows and doors and fills the city streets. Only you, from your temporary flight can see
the design that the ichor makes as it winds its way through the streets. The intricate patterns of the eye. You brace for the rude awakening, but before you can make it
to the ground, the voice breaks in your mind. It changes, where it has been a deep and pained voice, instead it takes on a feminine tone.

"They are here child, run!"

You start awake to a hand on your mouth and a dagger at your throat. An older woman, sun-weathered skin and wiry stray hair, crouches over you. Her eyes are gone and
her sockets have spiraling black designs that stretch out and across her face. The woman who in another lifetime pierced your eye with a needle.

"Your debts have come due, Sharifa."

------------------

I can't help but feel that there is some gravity to what you're about to deal with in the coming months. I just wanted to say that I wish you the best and am happy to call you a friend!
If you need anything from me, please don't hesitate to ask.
