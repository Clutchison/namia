Through giant’s arches and under a twinkling dome, ancient tapestries line the walls of a great marble hall. Dancing fires in gilded sconces reveal the woven silk images of a kingdom’s history. The monumental Djinn, animated by flame, towers over a tattered and broken people. Her expression flickers between contempt and pity in the unsteady light. With the wave of a hand, the mountains are cut into a shining white city. And from an immense throne of crystal, the Djinn sits and admires her handiwork. Scenes unfold across the frayed fabrics revealing centuries of prosperity and abundance until the great Djinn disappears from her glass palace. The sparkling sheen of the rich kingdom grows dull and tarnished without her. Tattered and broken once again, desperation leads robed men to ascend the holy mountain from which the white city was carved. Twisting, spiraling above the clouds, they climb to a heaven never before reached by mortals. At its summit, they find a second crystal throne, the twin to the one in the Djinn’s palace, but this one is not empty. Lying in it is a bundle of gold: a child touched by the sky and the heir of the Djinn.

A gust of wind snuffs out the light and the tapestries fall into darkness. Shadows invade the hall, speaking in whispers.

“You agree to join us against the Shah then, Sharifah?”

“My father is selfish. Under his rule, we are sure to return to the faded age. He must stand down and let my brother take the throne. I will join you.”

“Good, Sharifah. You are the only one who can get close to him. We will begin your training soon.”

With a soft exhale, the sconces magically re-light and the diminutive girl in elaborate dress is left standing alone amidst the history of her family’s rule.

* * *

Vehna, eighth daughter and eleventh child of Shah Ardashir, born of his fourth wife, Jaleh. A child of little consequence or importance, the youngest of the royal Zauba’at family spent her youth ditching etiquette training, escaping inattentive bodyguards, and wandering away from banquets. The impetuous black sheep eventually found herself descending from the palace to the tiered city below, discovering a wealth and extravagance not unlike her own juxtaposed against an impoverished and sickly caste. When confronting her father about the condition of his people, from which she was sheltered her whole life, Vehna learned of the repugnant indifference of the Shah.

Defiance had turned a new set of eyes in Vehna’s direction. Azi Simurgh, Grand Andarzbad to Shah Ardashir and leader of the Zhayedan, was in attendance that day. What he saw was a royal child whose blood granted her easy proximity to all the Zauba’at family. Whose likelihood of succeeding the throne was so far-fetched that her actions were shamelessly ignored. Whose brash contumacy surely set her against her father.

It wasn’t long before a note found itself under the young princess’ pillow:

We know you’re unhappy, Sharifah.
We are too. Help us make a change.
Bring your answer to where it all began.
Tonight, we will be waiting.

* * *

“Welcome to the Zhayedan, Sharifah.”

Azi Sumurgh, smile half obscured beneath a meticulously groomed mustache, now stood before Vehna within the long forgotten chambers below the palace.

“You may know us as the Shah’s secret police, but our organization is as old as the great Djinn. We’ve cherished her gifts for generations and have used her power to assist every Shah in matters of great importance to the kingdom. The Zhayedan have always been loyal to the Shah, but even above him, we are loyal to the people. Which is why you are here today. You’ve seen the injustices of the city. The Shah must relinquish his power for the good of all of us…”

Vehna was led into a large room, the floor and walls smooth as glass. Azi gestured at a large scroll, elegant but aged, displayed with care and purpose.

“This is the Qasidah. Written upon this papyrus are the secrets of the shadows, taught to our ancestors by the Djinn. Your lessons will be coming from this, our most important relic. With the blood of the Djinn in your veins and her teachings, you may be the most powerful in our order yet.”

Without time to get a good look, Vehna was ushered again into another chamber—this one completely black without light.

“It’s time for your initiation, Sharifah. Step forward, do not hesitate.”

Her first step into the dark was with caution, her next with confidence. Vehna steadily made her way forward. The vacuous gloom silencing even her own footfalls. Hours seemed to pass without anything disturbing the void. Until a pinpoint of light appeared on the horizon. Relief washed over the princess as the light grew in size. A small glowing lantern with two figures sitting around it came into focus as Vehna’s eyes adjusted. Two old women, twins, shadows emphasizing their cracks and wrinkles. Each reached out to Vehna with frail, clawed hands—motioning for her to sit with them.

Without faltering, Vehna sat between them. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a faint glint between the fingers of one of the old women. She raised her hand to Vehna’s face. It was a needle, its tip coated in something as sheer and black as the shadowed room through which she had walked.

“Lie still, child, and close your eye,” the woman with the needle said.

Vehna could not decide whether her tone—and the fact that, for the first time she could remember, someone other than her father or siblings had addressed her by anything other than her royal title—was comforting or frightening. Faster than Vehna had assumed possible, the old woman thrust the needle through her eyelid. Wracked with pain, she screamed for what felt like weeks and then in an instant, it was over. She caught her breath, her eyes fluttered open, the lantern was out, and yet she found she could see quite clearly. The woman without the needle thrust a mirror over her face.

“Look, child,” she whispered, “and see the eye of the Djinn.”

An intricate, spiraling mark surrounded Vehna’s eye—ink-black, yet stark in contrast to her shadowed complexion and the dull, desaturated void she was situated in. With the scrape of flint on steel, the lamp was lit again, and as its warm glow expanded across Vehna, the vivid mark faded into nothingness.

* * *

For months, Vehna drilled nightly with the twins. According to her teachers, she was well on her way to mastering the shadow arts; Azi Sumurgh an ever present ghost floating in her periphery, watching quietly. Until one day, he spoke, “Sharifah, you have taken well to your training. I knew with the blood of the Djinn so strong in your veins, you would find you had a talent for our arts. Now the time has come to play your part.”

“Sir,” and after a moment’s hesitation, “what will happen to the Shah?”

Azi glowered. “Your highness’ place is not to ask questions, but to answer them.” But his brows unfurrowed and a sympathetic smile took over, “I understand. He is your father. There will be no need for bloodshed, Sharifah. Rest assured, you are being trained as a spy, not an assassin.”

* * *

Vehna watched and listened and investigated for months more. Soon the connections became clear to her: her father’s corruption ran to a traitorous extreme. Not only had he built himself palaces and statues and commissioned the finest poets to compose panegyrics to stroke his ego while his people starved—he had abetted their starving, allowing barbarian chieftains and monstrous warlords to raid his food stores unopposed in exchange for secret deliveries of tribute they had pillaged from other lands. While everything she saw served as kindling for Vehna’s resolution, one night in particular lit a fire in her heart.

One by one, a dozen people from the under caste were escorted before the Shah. Swords held at their throats, two guards for each bound man and woman. Dry mud cracking on their skin and clothes. A mask of bold paint in the colors and lines of dangerous creatures hiding the details of their faces—yet, a fierce determination shone through.

“The insurgents, my liege. We captured them with barrels of stolen wine and grain. They killed the matriarch of the Radan family.”

Vehna now noticed the carmine stain on one of the prisoners. He wore the owl bear as his paint. She had heard conversation amongst the Zhayedan about Golseah Radan. They said she was helping smuggle food from the noble houses to the lower tiers. Something didn’t add up.

The King’s deep voice filled the room, “Kill them.”

“Wait!”

Surprisingly, the guards heeded the Sharifah’s words and stayed their blades, at least for the moment.

Vehna continued while her father watched. “These people deserve a trial. Don’t we have justice in this kingdom?”

Her father’s eyes crinkled with pity and condescension, in the way he always looked at her when she was a child.

“No.” And he turned back to his soldiers and gave the order.

The image of the owl bear’s defiant eyes at the end of his life is forever burned into Vehna’s memory.

Bit by bit, the Zhayedan built their case against the Shah.

* * *

On a chilly, moonless night, Azi summoned Vehna to the glittering glass chambers of the Zhayedan.

“Sharifah,” Azi said, “tomorrow, your father will host a grand ball. We have identified a certain merchant who will be in attendance. He has served as an intermediary between the Shah and the barbarian Khan. During the party, you must shadow your father and learn the time of his next collection so that we may capture this traitorous dealer and extract a public confession. Do well and this will all soon be over.”

With no more words, he was gone and Vehna was left to mentally prepare for the important day ahead. Without thinking where she was going, her mind a tumult of anxieties and hopes, she found herself in the company of her two elder mentors. They acted as grandmothers, brushing Vehna’s hair and soothing her with encouraging words. Then they were quiet. Nazadin was the first to speak again, “Vehna, Sumurgh intends to kill the Shah tomorrow.”

Mazaren followed, “There is dissent within the Zhayedan. Many wish to see Sumurgh take the throne himself, but there are some that think this is not the path of the Djinn.”

Nazadin gave the princess a tired smile, “Be careful. Use what we’ve taught you to stay out of the way.”

“All those with the blood of the Djinn could be targets.”

* * *

The ball was lavish and wasteful in the ways that everything her father loved was. Fountains bubbled with wine, servants presented imported delicacies on gold platters, court adepts filled the air with twinkling lights, performers from a troupe oft spoken about played (to Vehna’s ears, boring) music.

Flush with alcohol and wealth, the carefree nobles danced and laughed the night away. To the highborn that approached, Vehna smiled, hiding the edge her hatred and fear was whetting. A few men asked her to join them on the ballroom floor, but she declined, staying near her father, waiting for the attack—waiting for Sumurgh to make his move.

A boy, not yet over the hump of puberty, approached the Shah. Vehna recognized him from the chambers of the Zhayedan. He wordlessly handed over a folded letter and then headed off down a servant’s passage. Vehna watched over her father’s shoulder as he read the message.

Sharif Mohdet is dead.

Vehna’s eldest brother was gone and she couldn’t help but feel the target on her back growing. Panic washed over her and drowned out everything else.

By the time the sound of crashing waves had dimmed to a dull roar in her ears, the merchant, her mark, she realized, was already talking to her father. Then, everything went dark. The gasps and murmurs of the guests rolled over the immense ballroom in a second—the time it took Vehna’s eyes to adjust. With clarity, she could see the Eye manifesting on perhaps two dozen other faces in the ball, including the very merchant she was meant to be eavesdropping on. The “merchant” gave an evil grin to Vehna and swiftly grabbed her wrist. In his other hand, he manifested a blade from the shadows but so did the princess. Vehna was faster. She buried her sword deep into the abdomen of the man in front of her, then tore the weapon across his heart. Eyes locked with the man she had killed, she took a deep breath. Light had apparently returned to the room.

“The Shah! Oh, Gods! The Shah!”

Vehna blinked and the face of the merchant melted away to reveal gray eyes and a graying beard—the face of her father. From over his shoulder, she could see Azi Sumurgh, stepping out from the crowd, wearing a smirk just for her.

She withdrew her blade. The blood of the king—the divine blood of the Djinn—sprayed across her ballgown. His corpse followed, collapsing onto the hem of her dress, his dead hands curling around the fabric, his lifeless face pleading.

“Seize the Sharifah!”

The king’s assassin cut herself free and fled.

* * *

What the disinherited princess thought must be every Zhayedan and guard in the city was on high alert, combing the palace for her. Sneaking around had been a game to Vehna as a child and she was good at it, but Azi’s spies had years of experience over her. The tricks Nazadin and Mazaren taught her helped, but evading capture required her to push her skills—and luck—beyond their limit. By morning, she was cornered, and it wouldn’t be long before they found her.

“Pssst. Over here.”

It was the boy who delivered the message at the ball. He was standing at the threshold of a door, its edges seamless with the wall, only visible because it was ajar. She knew the Zhayedan had ways of getting around the palace unimpeded, but the use of the secret passages was never part of her tutelage.

“I’m here to help,” he said after noticing the princess’ apprehension.

“Thanks… What’s your name?”

“Tayan. They’re gonna be here soon. Let’s go!”

They moved quickly through a web of dark tunnels. Each branching path was unmarked and Tayan warned that many of them were trapped—in case someone other than the Zhayedan had gotten access. Vehna had to stoop under the low ceiling. She could tell her guide was moving slower for her and started to wonder if he wasn’t leading her into trouble. Suddenly, the tunnel spat them out in a room that Vehna had only seen once. It was Azi’s study. Tayan used a hand signal meaning ‘stay here, I’ll be back’ and slinked out the door. Vehna didn’t have to wait for more than a minute before he was back.

“The hideout is clear. Everyone is in the palace looking for you. I guess they didn’t think you’d be able to get in here. I have to join up with them now, sorry.” He hesitated, but shook his head and continued, “There’s an old passage—hasn’t been used in generations—that leads out into the lowest tier. In the scroll room, just look for the creepy tapestry with the Djinn’s shadow, it’s behind there.”

“Thanks for your help, Tayan. I owe you.”
“The Shah! Oh, Gods! The Shah!”

* * *

As the morning dawned, Vehna joined a trade caravan bound for a distant kingdom with nothing but the clothes on her back (her bloodied dress replaced with an undyed ensemble that a commoner might wear, including a sturdy traveler’s cloak); the only evidence of her previous life, a pair of black embroidered and jewel studded shoes caked in mud thick enough to hide their value. One last time she checked her bundle, where the gleaming artifact of the Zhayedan, the Qasidah was hidden, stolen from right under the nose of its master. Then she looked up at the horizon, where the rising sun spun a tapestry of gold and blue, and she imagined what future she might weave for herself.
