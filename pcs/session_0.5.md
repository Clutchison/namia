## Intro

- Clasp comes to as he recognizes the glassy look in his conversation partner. Lilly, a few years his junior, had always humored Clasp when his philosophical ideas needed to find a new ear. He must have been on quite the monologue, however, as he realized her last few minutes of conversational tennis had consisted of lobbing half-hearted "oh wows," "fascinatings," and "uh huhs" in random order.
- The awkward pause in his recital was broken by Clasp's stomach rumbling loud enough to startle Lilly.
- "Oh wow, you sound hungry, I'll let you get something to eat. Talk to you later Clasp!" And she hurried away.

You're in the center of Snailshell, the second largest settlement in Thousand-Lakes and the place you are proud to call home. It's well past midday, Noonflash was close to 3 hours ago, and the sun was beginning to dim on the horizon.  Around you, however, there is a bit more activity than is natural for Snailshell. In addition to the fishermen preparing for the evening catch, a group of traders had managed to make their way through the surrounding bogs and had set up shop. One apparently even had a bard, as you could hear singing and the sound of some kind of stringed instrument nearby.
