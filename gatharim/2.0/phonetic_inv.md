I'm in the process of creating a conlang called "Gatharim." The language has a sharp, angular sound with heavy use of the vowel "/a/" and the consonant "/th/".

Here is the complete phonetic inventory for the language:

Vowels:
/i/ as in "bit"
/e/ as in "bed"
/ɑ/ as in "cot"
/ɤ/ as in "word" (similar to the "u" sound in "burn")
/u/ as in "boot"

Consonants:
/p/ as in "pit"
/tʃ/ as in "church"
/k/ as in "kit"
/th/ as in "moth"
/q/ as in "qat" (a guttural sound similar to the "kh" sound in German "Bach")
/b/ as in "bat"
/dʒ/ as in "judge"
/g/ as in "go"
/ʕ/ as in "Achmed" (a pharyngeal sound similar to the Arabic letter "ayn")
/f/ as in "fist"
/s/ as in "sit"
/ʃ/ as in "shin"
/x/ as in "loch" (a velar fricative sound similar to the "ch" in Scottish "loch")
/h/ as in "hit"
/m/ as in "mat"
/n/ as in "not"
/ɾ/ as in "better" (an alveolar tap or flap sound)
/l/ as in "lot"
/ɣ/ as in "bag" (a voiced velar fricative sound)

Here are the phonotactics for the language:

Syllable structure: Let's say that we allow syllables with the following structures: CV, CVC, CCV, CCCV, and CCVCC. This means that we could have syllables like /ba/, /kat/, /skri/, /strɑp/, and /ath/.

Consonant clusters: Let's say that we allow consonant clusters in the beginning, middle, and end of words. This means that we could have words like /mɛks/, /flɪkt/, /spɪkt/, and /grɑmst/.

Vowel combinations: Let's say that we allow simple and complex vowels as well as diphthongs, but not triphthongs.

Stress and accent: Let's say that our language has a fixed stress pattern on the last syllable of a word.

Here are some words and their translations:

- drɤkt - "pursue"
- Gath - "Broken"
- Rim - "Word"
- Gatharim - "Broken Word"
- Anan - "Empty"
- Cracta - "Vessel"
- Drɤkt - "pursue"
- Nath - "until"
- Qal - "death"
- Prakɤn - "dreams"
- Grɤkth - "myself"
- Krimth - "shirk"
- Tɤlɤs - "all"
- Krɤmtɤs - "shackles"
- Vath - "only"
- Klikt - "duty"
- Fɤlth - "bonds"
- Nathrim - "weakness"
- Kraktɤs - "purged"
- Frimth - "drink"
- Grɤfthar - "life blood"
- Krɤktath - "oppressors"
- Rɤpth - "become"
- Nɤmth - "God"
- Prɤkt - "among"
- Tɤrimth - "insects"

The following in english:

"I will pursue until death my dreams, and I will shirk all shackles. My only duty is to myself. Bonds with others are weakness, and all weakness must be purged. I will drink the life blood of my oppressors, and I will become a God among insects."

translates to gatharim as:

"Drɤkt nath qal prakɤn grɤkth. Krimth tɤlɤs krɤmtɤs. Vath klikt tɤlɤs grɤkth. Fɤlth vath nathrim, kraktɤs tɤlɤs. Frimth grɤfthar krɤktath grɤkth. Rɤpth nɤmth prɤkt tɤrimth."

with the literal translation being:

"Pursue until death my dreams myself. Shirk all shackles. Only duty myself. Bonds with others weakness, purged all. Drink life blood oppressors myself. Become God among insects."
