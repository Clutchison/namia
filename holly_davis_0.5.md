Introduce the Snowdrift Inn. 
Damon is playing a game of Riku with Kishanfeng, an elderly Kanjorian who has settled in this remote settlement of Nymraestad.

## Intro

If you've ever known anything, Rennyn, you know one thing. Da'Mon is fucked. Again. It's been well over a week since anything exciting has happened up in the sleepy town of Nymraestad. The Snowdrift Inn is full to the brim tonight. You overhear Brynthalas telling his tired story of how he took on a bone devil by himself. The innkeeper Runathar is busying himself with a large order for a the Maelwynn family, who just walked in. You find yourself leaning against the wall, overlooking the scene. 

DESCRIBE

There is no music, as the bard that you have come to be mildly acquainted with is taking his daily beating from the other local oddity, an elderly Kanjorian named Kishan. In front of you, the two are crouched over a game of Riku. 

You don't know why you continue to try and win against this old shit. Every game has ended in him casually sweeping you under the rug. But his promise to tell you the meaning of his tattoos is a hard secret to leave unturned. 

"You're getting better, Da'Mon" Kishan chuckles under his breath.

I do need more ale, though. Don't try and cheat, I'll know. He winks and gets up from his seat.
