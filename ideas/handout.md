# J's Unbiased Account of Namía

Hi there, my name is J! Erm, well it's not J, that's more of a nickname. Or a letter. Or something. Regardless! I have painstakingly taken the time to document an overview of our beautiful, but sad. Beautifully sad, I guess. World. And since I wrote it, you should read it! Anyway, on to Namía! A sun that never sets. A sea without waves. A storm that has raged for 50 years. And above all, a tale that has yet to be told. Cue the lights and the music...





## A Brief History

Our tale takes place in 1004 PD (Post Dark). The world has divided itself into two nations, the Drakkur Empire to the East and the Nixian Coalition to the West. The two superpowers had been in a meat grinder of a war up until fifty years ago, when the sheer amount of magic unleashed in the conflict created the Everstorm, a continuous maelstrom that decimated the countryside.

To this day, the two nations lick their wounds. Neither side is happy with the outcome, but everyone is too weak to do anything about it. As governments struggle to feed their people, private organizations with money in their pouches move in to grasp at power.

### A sun that never moves, a crown of stars

In the world of Namía, the only Sun that any living being has ever known stands eternally to the East, far beyond the Sea of Glass and any known civilization. At night, the light of the Sun fades to reveal a crown of thirteen stars that rest on the Sun's brow. 

It has been said that in ages past the Sun moved across the sky, providing light to all, and that the night used to be littered with stars, so many that you could spend an entire lifetime devoted to the count.

In the darker corners of the world, some folk claim that another celestial body still travels the night sky, a great bone-white eye, watching the world with a deathly glare.

### The Drakkur Empire
To the east lies Drakkur. Here the sun shines bright, although straying too far East brings harsh temperatures and harrowing winds, making the cultivation of edible food challenging. 

It's capitol, Somberholde, is by a wide margin the largest city of the modern age. It was here that Archivus Drakkenhand of 27, First Mage, Angelbane, fought and died for what was left of humanity at the final moments of the Age of Dark. Now, the greatest learning institution since the Age of Stars rests here in his honor, and the Staves of Somberholde lead the people and carry out his interpreted and assumed desires.

### Thousand-Lakes

South of the capitol in Drakkur lies the myriad of small crystal-clear pools that comprise Thousand-Lakes. Surrounded by a mystical forest and sheapherded by a clan of Wood Elves, one could take in a single view of the majesty of the land and never leave again.

### The Singing Shores

At the southern border of Drakkur lies the windswept land of the Singing Shores. Villages carved into high cliffs seek shelter from the ripping winds, and peddlers sell small wonders brought all the way from the dark side of the world. On the sea, some fisherman live simple lives, while some ambitious captains hire waverunners to chase after the most fearsome creatures found in the depths. Together, the wind and the waves form a symphony unheard anywhere else in Namía.


### The Glass Sea

Past the last inhabital regions of Drakkur lies the vast desert known as the Glass Sea. Few creatures are able to make this desolate habitat their home, but the ones that do are to be respected and feared. It is said that this forgotten corner of the world was not always so, and many brave the oppressive heat and dangerous inhabitants in search of lost relics from a bygone era.

### Kanjor

Beyond the Glass Sea lies the nation of Kanjor. Little is known about the place itself, but Kanjorian monks can be found on all corners of the world, fulfilling their pilgrimages and finishing their vibrant tattoos that cover their bodies.

### The Stormlands

Above the Curtain and to the west of Drakkur lies the great valley now known as the Stormlands. Once the breadbasket of a world, then a bloody and entrenched battlefield, and ultimately a place torn apart by the Everstorm, a constant torrent of sulfurous rain and thunder.  Even so, adventure-seeking idiots or mercenaries in the employ of curious scholars still seek to pierce the gray veil and uncover the mysteries held by the arcane deluge.

Around the perimeter, a semblance of a normal life can still be found. Farmers work the land and travelers between the nations make their cautious journeys, clutching to their chest forecasts of Arcstorms, violent outbursts from the Everstorm proper. Waystones lined with ruby powder protect what few settlements remain from the arcane-infused nature's wrath.


### The Curtain

Drakkur's western border lies against the great Mountains known as the Curtain, blocking the Sun's light from reaching the lands beyond.  Beneath the earth, dwarves mine Arcstone, a resource sought after by power-seeking mages, ambitious inventors, and desperate addicts. The dwarves mine the matte red dust, sell it to the highest bidder, then sing and dance in the halls hewn by their forebears.

### Mornesari

High above the clouds, the legendary city of the Sky Elves makes its journey across the world. Here, the art-loving civilization sculpts sculptures, paints paintings, and sings songs, all in the name of their never ending search: to remember who they once were. The collossal mass floats along, dodging arcstorms and docking at major cities for trade. Some outsiders may be so lucky as to walk the streets of Mornesari, but only the chosen few know the secrets the city keeps, guarded since the last days of the Age of Stars.


### Nixia

To the West of the Everstorm lies Nixia, a land in darkness. Rather than the unified Drakkur, the Nixian Coalition brings together the three regions of the land. Though the entire world knew darkness only a thousand years ago, Nixians are the only ones who still know--and even embrace-- the night.

\column

### Kor

The central region of Kor is one of twilight. Here, stray beams of distant sunlight make their way through to shine dimmly upon the landscape.

Koradin, the capitol, houses the majority of the population. Here, progress is king. Members of all races come together to forward civilization. Due to the advent of the coldfire and the massive energy it provides, there seems to be a new invention every day.

Towering above the city lies the Kruciia, a lighthouse bearing the largest cold flame ever created, sending its white light all the way to the western waters of the Quiet Sea. 

### Eio 
Beyond the pale light of the Kruciia and into the northern alpine lies Eio, a cold and unforgiving landscape of snow-covered mountains, dense forests, and hard people. Here goliaths make sacrifices to the Night Mother, frost elves hunt stray demons that find their way through Augustine's Well, and beings from ages long past make deals with foolish mortals. Beyond this, there are tales of a frigid library, where attendants continue to catalog the history of the world.


### Sindelin

On the dark side of the curtain lies the veiled lands of Sindelin, where the denizens all have a pale yellow glint to their eyes. In between the dense forests and murky swamps lies ancient ruins, structures from another time. Who knows what wonders once occured in these forgotten halls. Now, they are used for worship, dark creatures calling out to alien beings beyond the void of the night sky.


### The Quiet Sea

The dark waters on the western edge of the continent offer little in terms of sustenance. Some mariners still seek out a living by hunting monsters prized for their components or scavenging wrecks of other unfortunate vessels. Here the ships carry no sails, as there is hardly any wind. Instead a brass lantern cradling a cold flame sits at the helm, while a flame whisperer coaxes it into carrying the passengers on to their destination.

### The Nameless Lands

An ancient civilization that still thrives? A dead landscape littered with naught but ash? Little is known about what lies beyond the Quiet Sea. A seemingly infinite wall of fog encompasses the horizon, and if one is lucky enough to make it home from those misty lands, it is likely that you will find you have left your sanity behind.

## Additional Races

### Frost Elf

Frost elves dwell in the brutal mountain peaks of icy realm of Eio. They guard their lands fiercely and remain isolated from the rest of the world. 

Tall and hardy, they are well suited to the difficult lives they live. Their skin is white, pale grey, or pale blue. Their hair is naturally black, silver-white, or grey, although many will dye their hair with brighter streaks of color. Their eyes are generally very pale shades of green or blue, but purple is also seen more rarely, as are darker shades of the same colors. They generally disdain metal decorations and armors (which are impractical in the cold), preferring leather, fur, and bone, but during the rare trading expeditions to the lowland races they covet silver above all else.

**Ability Score Increase**. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Snow Elf Training**. You have proficiency in the Survival skill, as well as with longbows, shortbows, spears, and javelins.

**Child of Always Winter**. You are acclimated to high altitudes and are naturally adapted to cold climates. In addition, you have advantage on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance on icy surfaces, and moving through difficult terrain composed of ice and snow costs you no extra movement. However, you are poorly suited to hotter climes, and the DC for Constitution saving throws against exhaustion in extreme heat increases by 2 every hour instead of by 1.

**Arctic Magic**. You know the Ray of Frost and Frostbite cantrips. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

With their long lives, their culture is dedicated to creating beauty and reciting history. Nearly all sky elves have monochromatic hair and eyes, though there are some exceptions. Nearly all of their works and attire include silver as the primary medium and color.


**Ability Score Increase**. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

**Sky Elf Training**. You have proficiency in either the Performance or History skill, and you have proficiency with sky vessels and ancient mechanisms.

**Echos of the Past**. You understand Celestial and you have advantage on rolls made to decipher ancient languages.

### Lakewalker Halfing


Lakewalkers know and appreciate a beautiful piece of the world like no other, and as such, few ever leave their home of Thousand-Lakes.

Though they are often overlooked by the rest of the world, you would never know it with their unstoppable confidence. Their skin is more tan than most other halflings, and they tend to stand an inch or two taller as well. An incredibly communal culture, lakewalkers always welcome anyone as family and are happy to simply do their part. However, on the rare occasion where fate summons them for a greater purpose, they rarely shy away from the call.

**Ability Score Increase.**
Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
