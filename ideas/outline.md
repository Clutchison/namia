# Campaign 1 - Tales of Namia: Storm, Shadow, and Light

The Angels are a Lovecraftian enemy that is returning, and Archivus Drakkenstorm has built a machine
to track greate souls as they are reincarnated. To prevent them from being harvested, the Somberholde 
find these children as they come of age and take them into hiding. An unfortunate side effect is 
these children awakening earlier than they are ready, which is often so traumatic that it leads to suicide.

The device uses the memories and power of Archivus to find the children, but he has died about a hundred years ago.
Somberholde has kept his body preserved, but his sould refuses to return to his body, and as a result,
there is no way to track and awaken the heroes.

The world is one that is recovering from a world war. There are divisions in culture, magic, science,
and religion that leaves most on edge. 

The land has been ravaged by magic. To the East lies the New Sun, beyond the Glass Sea. It hangs
in it's permanent place in the sky, waxing and waning in power. In the center of the land lies the 
Stormlands, a place wracked by magical storms left over from the Mage Wars. The light of the New Sun
wanes as you continue to travel West into the Shade, a darker region of cold forest and swamp.
Here lies the Quiet Sea, a cold expanse of water without wind, with the large wall of fog blocking 
the way into the Nameless Lands.

### Act 1 - The Somberchild and the Assassin

The first Somberchild in the last fifty years appears in Whiteglow. She is a daughter to an inkeep,
but in her previous lives, she was one of the greatest minds and was the creator of both the 
Clockwork Sun as well as the Deity Machines. She was in love with a powerful mage who was studying
the Deck of Many Things when she accidentally pulled a card, the Skull. The summoned avatar of death
took her life, and the mage spent the next fifty years trying to undo the magic of the deck, as
it prevented the resurrection of his wife. In his final act to absorb the magic of the artifact,
he was shattered into a myriad of clones of himself, each with the power of one of the cards, each 
immortal, and all with amnesia to his previous life.

The first Somberchild in the last fifty years appears in Whiteglow. Daughter to the inkeep, she 
has been having night terrors. She has been awoken by Dunlir, the Immortal Assassin, who has been
hiding in Whiteglow from the governments of the two nations.
