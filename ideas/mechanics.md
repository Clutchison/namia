# Mechanics

## Inspiration

Inspiration is now combat-specific

When you roll initiative, if your number rolled (without your modifier) is less than or equal to your character level, you gain initiative.

You also gain initiative if you are the last player to act.

Initiative can be used as normal. In addition, it can be used to automatically succeed on a death save.

## Enemy Murder Tactics

Whether or not an enemy will attempt to kill a downed player is based on it's intelligence.

- 0-8: If creature is aggressive, will always try to kill. If creature is defensive, will always back off.
- 9-14: Will only kill if feeling unthreatened. Will ignore healers until it has been made very obvious.
- 15+: Will make tactical decision including all information.
